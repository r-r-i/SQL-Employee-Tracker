# SQL: Employee Tracker

## Task

For this challenge I was given the task of building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and mySQL. Because this application is not deployed, I have created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. The link to the walkthrough video can be found below.

## Mock-Up

The following video shows the application being used from the command line.

## Installation Instructions

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```
```
npm i inquirer
```
```
npm i dotenv
```
```
npm i mysql2
```
```
npm i express
```

## Usage information

This application is purely made ont he back end, and does not have any front-end visual tied to it. 

- install Node.js before attempting to run the application.
- create .env with personal login
